# Tourism-Experience-Analytics

Welcome to another project of Tourism Experience Analysis where I built a classification, recommendation system for tourist prediction

**Steps**

1. **Data Cleaning:** where the repeated columns are removed after merging and removed the outliers
2. **Exploratory Data Analytics:** where User distribution, Average Rating has been focussed primarily
3. **Machine Learning:** Used Regression and Classification where the best performing algorithm has been trained
4. **Streamlit:** Created a application where a user can rate a particular attraction and the predictor can recommod the places that user can visit
5. **Data Storage:** Used mySQL connector library to store the databases
